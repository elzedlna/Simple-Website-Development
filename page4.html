              Above is one of my produces during my semester 1 in diploma.<br>
              I was assign with a group of four to do a music video.<br>
              To be frank, I was having a hard time adjusting and adapting<br>
              myself in editing but soon I realise, I was actually having fun<br>
              by doing so.<br>
              <br>Besides the music video i edited,<br>
              I created a form that was assign by my lecturer<br>
              as a practice to enhance our skill in html, css and<br>
              javascript.<br>
