                    This spicy, crispy, cheesy smash green chile cheeseburger is probably the best you’ll ever eat.
                    The cheese is melt-y and almost queso-y, the fire roasted hatch green chiles are fire, and the smashed patties are charred and juicy. Seriously amazing.
                    If you’ve had the chance to travel to New Mexico, you’ll know that the state slogan really rings true. New Mexico is the land of enchantment. Enchantment and green chile cheeseburgers. Green chile cheeseburgers, if you haven’t had the pleasure of trying them, are amazing. Fire roasted chopped green chile on top of a perfectly juicy burger with cheese in a buttery toasted bun – ugh, they just hit different.
                   </p><br>If you’re eating burgers in New Mexico and you order a burger, you’ll get the question: do you want chile on that? By chile (chile with an “e” by the way, never chili, which is chili con carne), they mean fire roasted and chopped green chiles. They have them year round but come late summer and fall, the hatch chiles start getting harvested and everything smells smoky and delicious from all of the fire roasting going on at all the grocery stores.
